# GuessTheNumber-
Finding the number guessed by the computer

The task is to write a Java program in which a user will get n number of trials to guess a randomly generated number.

Below are the rules of the game:
If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number,

Then the program will respond with the message that,the guessed number is higher than the actual number.

If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number,

Then the program will respond with the message that, the guessed number is lower than the actual number.

If the guessed number is equal to the actual number we set the default trials number =5

So,the loop wind up with the trial "5"  Then the program will end with a suitable message.
